# multithreading

In this repository, the following topics are covered:

[01 - multithreading task](https://github.com/NicoMrs/OOP-Challenges/tree/main/01%20-%20classes%20intro)
How to store data in a shared list ? Sequential option vs a multithreaded option are compared

[02 - race condition]
How to protect a shared file with a mutex lock so that it become thread safe ?.
Sequential writing, multithreaded writing with no lock and multithreaded writing with lock are compared.

[03 - ThreadPoolExecutor](https://github.com/NicoMrs/OOP-Challenges/tree/main/03%20-%20properties)
We will use the ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module which offers a simpler API than the threading module.
We will compare map and submit functions.


[04 - Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/NicoMrs/OOP-Challenges/tree/main/04%20-%20inheritance)
We will show a concrete example on how to multiply matrices using multithreading. Multiplying matrices is in fact a CPU bound task. We 
will show that multithreading doesn't show much gain. On the contrary we will show that multiprocessing can offer better results.

[05 - Threaded Pipelines](https://github.com/NicoMrs/OOP-Challenges/tree/main/05%20-%20slots)
We will show how to generate multithreaded pipelines to download and store information about images.
